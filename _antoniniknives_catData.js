Laser incision removes the anodized color layer revealing the uniform single light grey shade of the original aluminum. Laser incision can also be performed on the blade and offers an excellent sense of contrast. This type of incision is permanent, cannot be modified and adds a degree of exclusivity to a product. For the reproduction of brand names and logos, proof of ownership or authorisation must be provided and the logo or brand name needs to be provided in digital EPS or TIFF format.
